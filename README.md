# Project Repository

# Welcome to MyDreamInternship!
### About the Project
It is a platform for students to find internships at FAANG companies, create applications, track them, and look for open vacancies in dream companies. Currently many students even don't know how to search for companies and apply for them. The applying process includes visiting a company website and looking for requirements and open vacancies. And in case you are applying for bunch of companies, you have to iterate the process bunch of times for each company. Students' applications are scattered in different places like Google Doc, Notes, etc. Hence, there is no structure in facilitating applications and it takes a lot of time to handwrite the application from scratch; thus it is inefficient.

### The program will offer:
* a platform with up to date open internships
* a simplified user interface to search and filter for open roles
* a list of companies that offer internships
* information on each company (benefits, reviews)
* centralized place to store profile details
* dashboard for tracking applications with appropriate deadlines and statuses
